### Basic cpu implementation with IO (Which takes very basic source code and compiles it)
### Basic assembler implementation is included.

This cpu implementation has its stack lists within and can be used for further development.

This implementation isn't professional and can have some bugs!

Source code, assemled code and compiled file examples are under examples section.

## How to
To simply execute assembler and cpu just use ./test.sh on the shell.

### Basic cpu implementation with IO (which takes very basic source code and compiles it)
### Basic assembler implementation is included.

This cpu implementation has its stack lists within and can be used for further development.
I know they are not professional nor for essential use, so don't ever depend them :)
Source code ,assemled code and compiled file xamples are under examples section.

## How to
To simply execute assembler and cpu just use ./test.sh on the shell.

Basic cpu implementation with IO (which takes very basic source code and compiles it)

This cpu implementation has its stack lists within and can be used for further development. And to build a basic virtual machine or a basic language(need of lexer, I'd include lexer and even a gui to this project) there are bunch of other components should be implemented..

Source and compiled file examples are under bin/debug section.
